This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving unexpected null or undefined values passed as function parameters. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.  The issue arises when a function doesn't explicitly handle the possibility of receiving null or undefined parameters, potentially leading to errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'property')`. The solution involves adding checks for these values at the start of the function and handling them appropriately, such as returning null or throwing an error.
